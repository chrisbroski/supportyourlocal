What would a local band need?

## Key Features

### MVP

* Mobile-first design
* Home page with sections
* EPK
* Gigs / Previous gigs
* Contact information

### Email

Managing an email list and sending out newsletters and updates is something that I have not found a source I like for yet. This is a key feature.

### Browser Push Notifications

Killer feature! This is what everyone will want. (So dont' implement until the core structures are done and there are at least 10 beta users.)

### Song List

This will not only be a source of information for their home page, but will fuel set list creation. Data should include song title, artist, link (or links) to audio, duration, and flags for featured and mothballed.

### External Links

This site is meant to be a central location. You can upgrade (or downgrade) your site to paid/self-hosted at any time without penalty or hassle. (If you wanted a custom domain, for instance.) Everything else can be linked to.

### Style Guide

It will make style guides easy and fun! Home pages and emails will use templates that will apply the styles automatically. This is the real killer feature.

### The Rest

Fan accounts. Like/follow bands. Write "reviews"

## Monitization

Custom domain, more storage space (for photos.)

Advertise for local venues and bands.

Add "powered by yourlocal.band" on site.

## API Style

Endure backup and parse test. (In case of catastrophic failure.)

## Features for next version

Data tools (QA and deploy scripts.)

Password recovery (request to me - no email yet)

### Tests

Songs partially done. The rest, not at all

## Features for next next version

Get local features working with member cities. "Check in" on mobile when at open mics, etc.

Set up back end as front end ("secure" and "private" - no JS or cookies. Also accessible. Talk to Rob C!)

3rd-party cookie option (will replace maps and audio embed with external links)

### Email List

Export instructions to email them your damn self. Add phone number too for mass spam texting.

## Central Site

### Blog articles

Funnel from QR code to persistent connection.

## Before Next 10

Onboarding process, password recovery via email, data tools (backup and restore data.json, local QA and deployment.)
